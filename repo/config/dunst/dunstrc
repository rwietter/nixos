    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.

    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the

    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.

    ### Legacy

    # Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.
    # This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly
    # discouraged.

    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.

    ### mouse

    # Possible values are:
    # * none: Don't do anything.
    # * do_action: If the notification has exactly one action, or one is marked as default,
    #              invoke it. If there are multiple and no default, open the context menu.
    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    # * close_all: Close all notifications.
    # These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
    # will be executed in sequence.
